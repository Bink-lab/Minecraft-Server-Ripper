# Minecraft-Server-Ripper
MCSR Is a tool that extracts useful data from a minecraft server.

# How to use

To use MCSR you need to have the IP of the minecraft server you want to scan and paste it into the input.

# Conversion

I have used Pyinstaller to convert this instead of `Nuitka` because of the false positives.

# Open source

This code is open source and free to use :)
